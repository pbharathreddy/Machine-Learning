# Machine-Learning
A detailed guid into machine learning with python.

Note-A pre-requisite to understanding the below content will be a basic statistics and probability, also fundamentals of Python. I will try to keep that math simple and will explain any tangents as we progress. 

## Before we dwell into machine learning, let's start by understanding what machine learning essentially is.

  Machine learning is essentially trying to program a computer to perform tasks without explicitly having programed it to do so. This is acheived with help of algorithims and statistical modeling that help it solve problems by identifying patterns and making inferences. 
  This acheived by first writing an algorithm that trains itself of a large data set to idenity patterns within that data and then superimposing these patterns on a new data in question.
