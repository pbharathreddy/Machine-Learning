# Types of Machine Learning Algorithms
There are mainly **3** types of algorithms a machine learning model can be trained:
      1. Supervised 
      1. Unsupervised
      1. Reinforcement

Let’s take an example to understand these terms:

Think about the time when you were a school kid, try to recreate the picture of your typical Math classroom. Even today, I get freaked out to imagine my teacher calling me to solve an example on the blackboard in front of my class! 
So, the problem might be of the following type:
* Your teacher has solved a problem on the blackboard and has asked you to solve a **similar** one! Hmm, not bad actually. This teacher of yours sounds really good!
* Your teacher has just written a problem and the solution is, well, you have to find out by **yourself**, the only hint is more amount of similar kind of problems given. Your task is to figure out the pattern in those problems and to come up with a solution. Sounds like fun and challenging, this teacher has their own way of teaching!
* Your teacher calls you to solve a problem **without** giving you any hint, you just have to start solving it, they will give you a chocolate if you going on a right track  or else they will give you an extra assignment as a punishment, so you have to figure out how to get more chocolates and fewer assignments as possible, i.e which similar kind of steps to repeat to get a **reward**, this sounds the hardest, your teacher is simply a legend!!

## 1. Supervised learning:
Supervised learning is the first type of problem discussed above. When a model is trained with **features** (problem statement in our example) **along** with the **labels** (solutions of the problem), it is known as supervised learning. It is used to solve types of problems like **classification and regression**.
A classification problem is when our y, the output variable, the dependent variable or any name which you like the best, is a **categorical** variable and using the features you have to predict the label belonging to one class or the other, while a **regression** problem is when the label is a continuous value and not belonging to a certain class, having a big possibility of values. More on that later.

Enough of spoon-feeding! Now let’s go to the second algorithm, unsupervised!

## 2. Unsupervised learning:
