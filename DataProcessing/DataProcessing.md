# Data Processing
Data processing is the process of collecting and converting data to produce meaningfull information. Data in its raw form more often than not is useless. Relavant processing techniques need to applied to derive patterns.
### Data processing can be broadly classified into 3 steps:
1. Select data
2. Pre-process data
3. Transform data
### select data:
It is important to select the right type of data for a required use case.
1. It is important to understant what data necessary might not be available. Once we know this we can try to derive the missing or simulate the missing data from the remaining dataset.
2. It is also important to ignore or remove unecessary and redundant data. This not only reduces the complexity it also decreases the runnign time of the algorithim.
